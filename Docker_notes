docker is product which uses  docker engine
virtulization
light weight
reusability

learn about hypervisor -it is a layer on os it treats os as a host

solution docker engine
docker engine  1 docker d (deamon) and inside docker d there is a process running call container d it is a opensource tool of cncf it is a tool helps us to create containers and run our application
               2 docker cli
it is lightweight because it doesnt use its own kernel  the container has os but it  doesnt use its own kenel
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo apt purge docker.io
systemctl status docker  
sudo docker ps (but dont use sudo every time for that do -> sudo cat/etc/group   then add your user ununtu or what evern in docker group run command -> sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu  then sudo reboot)


file ->image ->container
image has everything that we need to run an application
docker ps 
docker pull mysql  (we are pulling it from dockerhub)
docker images
docker run mysql:latest
now it will require password so we will use another command to set the environment variable
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD= test@123 mysql:latest
docker kill _container_id(to kill the container)
docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD= test@123 mysql:latest (to run in background)
